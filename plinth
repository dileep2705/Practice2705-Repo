The Plinth Assemblage, also known as the Plinth Formation, is an accreted terrane of igneous rocks in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, located just north of the Lillooet River and on the northern flank of the Mount Meager massif. It is named after Plinth Peak, a peak made of Plinth Assemblage rocks.[1]
