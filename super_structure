A superstructure is an upward extension of an existing structure above a baseline. This term is applied to various kinds of physical structures such as buildings, bridges, or ships.[1]

Aboard ships and large boats
On water craft, the superstructure consists of the parts of the ship or a boat, including sailboats, fishing boats, passenger ships, and submarines, that project above her main deck. This does not usually include its masts or any armament turrets. Note that, in modern times, turrets do not always carry naval artillery, they can also carry missile launchers and/or antisubmarine warfare weapons.
